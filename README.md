# Responsive Portfolio

Using Bootstrap Components and HTML elements I created a Portfolio site that is responsive to three screen widths. 640px, 768px, and 980px.

Using such Bootstrap components as Cards, Navbars, and Forms, I created an About Me page, a Portfolio Page, and a Contact page that included a Name field, an email field and a Message box.

These elements were then styled using an external CSS sheet which altered formatting, layout, and aesthetic.

The Navbar links the three pages together both in the form of hyperlinks, but also providing aesthetic constistency.
